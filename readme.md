## Shop demo
* This project aims to optimize order processing and decrease time spent in a shop by generating a virtual map that guide the user in a store based on a shoping bucketlist.
* Also, in the future, this could be used by delivery services like uber eats, deliveroo, etc.. to reduce the time spent on getting all the products from a store and complete the order.

## Project state
* The project is still in it's "infancy" as it's developed by only one persone.
* For now this is just a in a POC state but ideas are rapidly flowing in and I try implement them as fast and reliable as possible.

### Required libraies
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Usage
* Please view `main.py` for code examples.
